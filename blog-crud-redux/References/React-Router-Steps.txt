Routing 
----

  Step 0:
  --
    npm i react-router-dom 

  step 1: 
  ---
    identify the URLs and have them in menus 
      Home    - http://localhost:3000/
      Posts   - http://localhost:3000/posts
      About   - http://localhost:3000/about 
      Contact - http://localhost:3000/contact

  Step 2: 
  ---
    Let's create 4 components 
      Home.js 
      Posts.js 
      About.js 
      Contact.js 

  Step 3: 
  ---
    3.1 - Have the entire app under <BrowserRouter>
    3.2 - Config the routes in App.js 
          Refer latest react-router-dom's  doc https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/upgrading/v5

        
    ------

  Step 4: 
  ---
    Check the app. URL will change. Comp is loaded in between header and footer 
    But Pages will reload. Let's fix it. 

    Replace all <a href> tags with <Link to> from 'react-router-dom'. 

It is over. We have an SPA!.
