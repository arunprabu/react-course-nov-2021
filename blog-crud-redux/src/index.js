// Step 1: Setup the Redux store 
import { createStore } from 'redux'; // npm i redux

// Step 5: letâ€™s import the combinedReducer / rootReducer
// and pass it to the store as an argument.
import rootReducer from './reducers';

// Step 6: Now the store is properly setup. Provide the store data to the entire app 
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
//Definition: The Provider component uses something 
  //called as React Context which allows you to pass the 
  //store object to any components 
  //that needs to access it without the need to pass props.
  //Provider should be imported from react-redux 

// Step 2: Exec createStore() method and save it in a variable 
const store = createStore(rootReducer); //this needs a special param called 'reducer' and an optional enhancer
// Now, After Step 5, store would have dispatch, subscribe properties and app wide data too
